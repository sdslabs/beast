[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/bea0e0b4-30e1-4830-ba98-e484b51e4036/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/beast-docs-sdslabs/deploys)    [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/deepshpathak/deepshpathak/_apis/build/status/sdslabs.beastv4?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/deepshpathak/deepshpathak/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

## Development

Beast go version is under development, follow the below instructions to get started.

* Install go 1.11.x
* Make sure that `GO111MODULES` environment variable should be set to `on`, or do `export GO111MODULES=on`
* Clone the repository.
* Jump to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/sdslabs/beastv4/` and start hacking.

```bash

BEAST: An automated challenge deployment tool for backdoor

* build: Build beast and copy binary to PATH set for go build binaries.
* check_format: Check for formatting errors using gofmt

**All the dependencies are already vendored with the project so no need to install any dependencies**. The projcet uses go modules from 
go 1.11.X fo dependency management. Make sure you vendor any library used using `go mod vendor`

### Building

* `make build`

This will build beast and will place the binary in `$GOPATH/bin/` will also copy the necessery tools to desired place. To build this in production make sure you also have built the static-content docker image in `/extras/static-content`

To run the API server for beast use command `beast run -v`

	* This directory contains example challenges for beast.
	* An example beast global root config to be placed in `$HOME/.beast/config.toml`

### Testing

To test use the sample challenges in the `_examples` directory. Use the challenge simple and try to deploy it using
beast. Follow the below instructions.

You can find swagger API documentation here: http://localhost:5005/api/docs/index.html

```bash
# Build beast
$ make build

# Run beast server
# Beast server will start running on port 5005 port by default
$ beast run -v

# In another terminal Start the local deployment of the challenge, using the directory
$ curl -X POST localhost:5005/api/manage/deploy/local/ --data "challenge_dir=<absolute_path_to_challenge_simple>"

# Or you can directly deploy the challenge using name in the remote
$ curl -X POST --data "action=deploy&name=<challenge_name>" localhost:5005/api/manage/challenge/

# Wait for beast to finish the image build and deployment of the challenge
# This might take some time. Have some snacks ready!
# Try connecting to the deployed service
$ nc localhost 10001

### Documentation

The documentation for the project lies in [/docs](/docs). We use `mkdocs` to automatically generate documentation from markdown. The configuration file for the same can be found at [mkdocs.yml](/mkdocs.yml). To view the documentation locally create a virtual environment locally and install [requirements](/requirements-dev.txt).

```bash
$ virtualenv venv && source venv/bin/activate

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ mkdocs serve

### Development notes

Beast uses `logrus` for logging purposes and follow standard effective go guidelines, so anytime you are writing a code keep in mind to 
add necessery logs and documentation. Also format the code before commiting using `gofmt`. Or simply run the make command `make test`

For any API routes you add to the beast API do write Swagger API documentation.

The design documentation for the new Beast can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BlRes900aFS2s8jicrSx2W7b1t1FnYZhx70jGQu__HE/edit)
